Change log 1.01 : 

Updated altf4.vbs to UplayToSystemTray.vbs

altf4.vbs simply invoked ALT+F4 key-press and at times did not work out as intended. UplayToSystemTray.vbs now invokes ALT+F4 only if the Uplay window is visible.

Change log 1.5 :

Created separate files after it stopped working after Uplay's update of its own "Startup on Windows" option. Also created an installation wizard to make the installation process easier.
