These scripts basically help you to launch Uplay on startup and minimize it to system tray after 30 seconds(changeable):

   1. Make sure of the following settings:

    a. "Minimize Uplay to system tray when the application window is closed" should be kept enabled in Uplay's settings.

    b. "Launch Uplay when Windows starts" should be kept disabled as we prefer to use the manual method[*].

    c. Ensure you can view file extensions in Windows

  2. Create a shortcut to "Uplay.vbs" and "MinimizeSysTrayWait.vbs" that have just been installed in the Uplay game launcher folder.

  3. Press Windows key+R

  4. Enter "shell:startup" without the quotes in the Run dialog box.

  5. Once you are shown the startup directory, move the shortcuts to the same location.

  6. You're done! Restart and see it work.

P.S:

This method works only if Uplay is on display as a foreground running application after startup. To change the time to take for minimizing it, you can edit the "MinimizeSysTrayWait.bat" file where time is set in milliseconds. Choose a suitable duration which Uplay takes to auto-login, initialize and finally bring up the client window.

In cases when Uplay updates itself after starting up, requiring more time, make sure it doesn't get closed as "ALT+F4" in "UplayToSystemTray.vbs" would still get invoked which would make Uplay exit itself out. To avoid this, just minimize it manually to the taskbar while it updates.

[*]Waiting via MinimizeSysTrayWait.bat separately, as using these lines on the original script no longer works after Uplay got updated with its own startup option: "Launch Uplay when Windows starts" (does not seem to work and still need to keep it unchecked and use the manual way).
