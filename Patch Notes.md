Change log 1.01 : 

Updated altf4.vbs to UplayToSystemTray.vbs

"altf4.vbs" simply invoked ALT+F4 key-press and at times did not work out as intended. "UplayToSystemTray.vbs" now invokes ALT+F4 only if the Uplay window is visible.

Change log 1.1 :

Created separate files after it stopped working after Uplay's update of its own "Startup on Windows" option. Also created an installation wizard to make the installation process easier.

Change log 1.1.1 :

Using another "UplayAltTAB.vbs" to make sure Uplay is the active window (assuming no other windows are displayed on startup).

Change log 1.1.2 :

Installer updated. Executable version of the vbs file is being used and also, the user no longer needs to copy a shortcut to the same to startup folder.
